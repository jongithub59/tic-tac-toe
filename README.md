# Tic Tac Toe Game App

## An Interactive Game Between Two Rivals

This project was built following the Odin Project [curriculum]([https://www.theodinproject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)
and plays just like teh real TIc Tac Toe game.

Live preview [here](https://jongithub59.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).

## Features:

* Interactive board that marks teh square you click
* Choose which hero to play as before the game starts
* Uses icons of the two heros to mark squares

## Reflection:

* Learned to separate game and ui logic so the game is fully playable in the console first
* Learned how to make decoupled code that works independently
* Learned how modules relate to each other and how to link them together
* Learned to make objects/modules that perform as specific as possible tasks, and no more
